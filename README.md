## Description

A portfolio website for me, Colin McMurtray. This is so I can showcase the work that I have done during my time at UNC Chapel Hill Coding Bootcamp
and perhaps other projects outside of the bootcamp. Potential employers will be able to navigate the website and be taken to other pages when they 
click on elements that contain hyperlinks, such as project images or an element of the contact info section.
